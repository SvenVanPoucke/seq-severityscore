# Developing Well Calibrated Illness Severity Scores for the Most Critically Ill

## Background
Illness severity scores have demonstrated poor generalization performance in forecasting
mortality, particularly for patients at the highest risk of mortality. One of the drivers of this discrepancy is the
preponderance of patients at low risk of death in training cohorts and the inflexibility of predicting mortality risk across the spectrum of disease severity with a single, inflexible, linear model. We explored a two stage, sequential modeling approach, and compared it to using a simple linear model as well as a state-of-the-art machine learning method.
